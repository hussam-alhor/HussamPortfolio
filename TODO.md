# TODO List for Portfolio Component Fixes

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Add mobile detection logic in Portfolio.jsx
- [x] Implement conditional transform (xTranslate for desktop, no transform for mobile)
- [x] Update portfolio.css to set flex-direction: column, position: static, height: auto for .pList on mobile, and portfolio height: auto, overflow-x: hidden
- [x] Fix progress circle SVG to use strokeDasharray and strokeDashoffset instead of pathLength
- [x] Make empty div and sections conditional (only on desktop)
- [x] Disable scroll-snap on mobile in index.css to prevent fast scrolling

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Test the changes on Vercel or local server to ensure mobile scrolling works correctly
- [ ] Verify that desktop behavior remains unchanged
- [ ] Check for any additional responsive issues

## Notes
- Mobile threshold set to < 1024px width
- On mobile, no transform applied, layout is normal vertical stack with each item 100vh
- On desktop, horizontal scroll with transform
- Progress circle now properly animates from 0 to full circle
